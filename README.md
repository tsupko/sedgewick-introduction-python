Project follows the programs and exercises from the textbook by Sedgewick &amp; Wayne "Introduction to Programming in Python: An Interdisciplinary Approach" (2015).

Here you will find out my current progress in studying this amazing chef d'oevre. As the title suggests, the book provides a comprehensive account on the Python language and its applications to various scientific problems.

The textbook is divided into 4 chapters as follows:
<ol>
<li><i>Elements of Programming</i></li>
<li><i>Functions and Modules</i></li>
<li><i>Object-Oriented Programming</i></li>
<li><i>Algorithms and Data Structures</i></li>
</ol>

My primary interest is to answer all the questions at the end of each paragraph and to solve all the problems the authors suggest in order to advance my level of expertise in Python and problem solving using algorithms and data structures.
